# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection using AI/ML 🤖🧪

A powerful deep learning project built with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **PyTorch**, aimed at detecting leaf diseases in plants with high accuracy. Trained on real-world datasets, this AI system empowers farmers and agricultural scientists to **identify plant diseases early** and take preventive measures — before the damage is done. 🚜🌱

## 🚀 Why This Project?

Agriculture is the backbone of many economies, yet plant diseases often go unnoticed until it's too late. With my background in **Computer Science & Business Systems**, and experience in **AI/ML**, **SAP**, and **real-world project development**, I wanted to build something that **actually matters** — something that merges technology with impact.

```

📈 Model Performance

    🔍 Accuracy: 94.3%

    📉 Loss: Reduced steadily over 25 epochs

    🔁 Evaluated using cross-validation and test splits

📖 Learnings & Insights

    Trained a CNN from scratch instead of relying on transfer learning for more control

    Found that data augmentation significantly improved robustness

    Understood the importance of balanced datasets for real-world deployment
